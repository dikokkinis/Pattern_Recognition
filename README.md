# Lab1: Development of a Basic Optical Recognition System of Numerical Digits using Various Methods

*We used statistical properties, developed an Euclidean Distance classifier, a Naive-Bayes classifier, a SVM and Nearest-Neighbors classifier and scratched the surface of Neural Networks*

# Lab2: Speech Recognition with Hidden Markov Models and Recurrent Neural Networks

*Using specialized Python packages (librosa, scikit-learn, PyTorch), we extracted acoustic features from Phonetic data. We developed a recognition system for recognizing spoken digits.*
